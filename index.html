Welcome! My name is Zhengqiao Luo.My primary research areas include deep learning, computer image processing, and embedded systems. During my graduate studies, I maintained a GPA of 3.8/4.0, ranking within the top 10% of my class. I was awarded the 2023 Graduate National Scholarship.
I have authored one SCI paper as the first author, published in a top-tier journal in the SCI-1 category with an impact factor of 8.0. Additionally, I actively participate in various academic competitions and have received over ten provincial and national awards, including a second prize in the National Graduate Electronic Design Competition and a third prize in the Huawei Cup National Graduate Mathematical Modeling Competition.
Furthermore, I have applied for three patents, including one utility model (already granted) and two invention patents (currently under review).
