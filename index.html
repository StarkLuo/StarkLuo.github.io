Welcome! My name is Paul and I am a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, D.C., and teach classes on text mining and financial analytics at the University of Maryland. I also am currently a <a href="https://www.fdic.gov/analysis/cfr/visiting-advisors/research-fellow.html">Research Fellow</a> at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

<br><br>
My research focuses on understanding the role banks play in the real economy. I am also interested in financial and economic questions related to the usage and interpretability of machine learning and natural language processing techniques to quantify unstructured data, particularly text. My <a href="https://pesoto.github.io/research" target="_self">research</a> has appeared in leading academic journals including <i>Management Science</i>, the <i>Journal of International Economics</i>, and the <i>Journal of Financial Services Research</i>.
